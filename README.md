## ⚡️ Introduction

Localy is a web application designed for one purpose: think and act locally. Check out local organizations in need of financial or skill-based assistance or news regarding what's going on in your community. At the time this README was created, COVID-19 is still a global pandemic and local businesses have taken a hit as a result. However, pandemic or not, the need to support local endeavours exists in any scenario. It is our hope that this project inspired people to think, engage, and act locally.

## 🎯 Features

At the moment, Localy provides following features to its users

- see businesses, schools, hospitals, orphanages, and other organizations in need of help
- stay up-to-date on business, tech, and science news

In a future version, we hope to incorporate the following features
- view and attend local meetups
- engage with other users/organizations via social media functionality

## 👨🏻‍💻 Technologies

We made use of the following technologies for this project.

### 🌐 React.js

The clientside of the application was built using React.js, a JavaScript frontend library developed by Facebook. Some other frontend considerations included:

- Redux for state management
- Bootstrap for styling
- Material UI for icons

### 💥 Flask

The serverside was built with Flask, a lightweight Python web development library. The following libraries were used in addition to Flask:
- Flask-RESTful to create and organize endpoints
- Flask-MongoEngine to create database tables/columns and interact with database

### 📦 MongoDB Atlas

For a database, we used MongoDB Atlas, a cloud NoSQL database. In order to carry out CRUD functionalities to maintain database content we used Flask-MongoEngine, an ODM (Object Document Mapper; see Flask section above).
