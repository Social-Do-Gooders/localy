Assuming you already have python installed and you have already changed directory to `server`:
1. Install virtualenv (if you don't already have it):
    - `pip install virtualenv`
    - this creates virtual environment where all packages will be installed (similar to `npm init`)
2. Create virtual environment directory
     - `virtualenv venv`
3. Activate virtual environment
    - Windows: `source venv/Scripts/activate`
    - OS/Linux: `source venv/bin/activate` (I think)
    - you should see `(venv)` in your terminal
4. Install packages
    - `pip install -r code/requirements.txt`
    - Installs all packages outlined in this file
5. Run server
    - `python code/app.py`
